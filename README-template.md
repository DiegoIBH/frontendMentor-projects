## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- NPM

### What I learned

I used this exercise to practice a project with Bootstrap (customized with Sass). 
Also, wanted to feel more confortable using npm and construct a work envirnoment with specific dependencies to use for a faster production process (I deleted the node folder and extracted mini filesfor a optimized project).

```html
<h1>Practice customizing Bootstrap variables</h1>
```
```css
$dark-purp: hsl(293, 82%, 45%);
$focus-ring-opacity:.50;
$primary: $dark-purp;

$focus-ring-width:      .25rem !default;

$focus-ring-color:      rgba($primary, $focus-ring-opacity) !default;
$focus-ring-blur:       0 !default;
$focus-ring-box-shadow: 0 0 $focus-ring-blur $focus-ring-width $focus-ring-color !default;

@import "../assets/sass/bootstrap.scss";
```
